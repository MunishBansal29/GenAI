Data Acquisition: Data / Image Augmentation, punctuation removal etc? (For preparing test data?). Different techniques?
Data Preprocessing: -> Say removing the unnecessary images / emojis from the text etc.. 
				     -> Tokenisation : splitting text/ sentences into words etc.
				    ->Lemmatisation : Converting words to root level e.g. Wrote -> Write

Advanced preprocessing: :Parsing etc.
